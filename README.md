## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Microsoft Passport

This project uses Node.js and the Express.js framework to create a full-stack CRUD application that uses Microsoft Passport to allow the user to create a profile and log in. Once logged in, the user can save their favorite items from a given list of produce in season during the current Month.

## Lessons Learned:
Working on this app was an opportunity to continue to practice the skill of creating CRUD full stack apps. This project uses Microsoft Passport login authentication to create and authenticate user logins. In addition, this app uses multiple routes, as the user is navigating between distinct pages on the website.
